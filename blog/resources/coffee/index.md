Resources for coffee? Yes!

There's another world beyond instant coffee and Starbucks. There's nothing wrong with these if that's what you like, though you're missing out if you haven't experienced anything else.


## Coffee Shops

Here's a list of coffee shops I've visited and would recommend if you'd like to experience great coffee:

### London

- Kiss the Hippo Coffee (Fitzrovia)
- Omotesando Koffee (Fitzrovia)
- Rosslyn Coffee Queen (Victoria Street)
- WatchHouse (Tower Bridge)
- Curious Roo Coffee Roasters (Ealing)

### Cambridge

- Bould Brothers Coffee (Church St)
- Hot Numbers Coffee (near the train station)
