I enjoy going to the gym and I used to compete in [powerlifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting). Finding accurate and useful information on fitness (specifically bodybuilding) is difficult, so I'm sharing some resources I've found to be useful.

## Resources

The best single resource *by far* I've found on hypertrophy training + nutrition is [Mike Israetel's Renaissance Periodization](https://www.youtube.com/c/RenaissancePeriodization).

Another great resource is [Eugene Teo's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/eugeism).


## Equipment

If you do any pulling movements I highly recommend [Versa Gripps](https://www.versagripps.com/).
