Welcome to my website!

# About Me

## What I do

I am currently working as a `Risk Analyst` at a Hedge Fund in London, though I spend most of my time coding. Please see my [CV](/files/nikul_patel_cv.pdf) for more details.

## Getting in Touch
Please reach out to me on LinkedIn/Email (details in my CV and on the homepage) if you'd like to get in touch.

# About the Website

## Why It Exists

I build this website to:
- Share resources for things I'm interested in
  - see the [Recources](/resources) tab
- ... and to document things I'm working on.
  - see the [Projects](/projects) tab


## It looks cool, how did you make it?
I built this using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed it using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). See [here](/projects/this_website) for more details.
