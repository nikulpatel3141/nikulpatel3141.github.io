# About the Website

## Why It Exists

I build this website to:
- Share [Resources](/resources) for things I'm interested in.
- Document [Projects](/projects) I'm working on.

## It looks cool, how did you make it?
I built this using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed it using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). See [here](/projects/this_website) for more details.
