## About Me!
I am currently working as a `Risk Analyst` at a Hedge Fund in London, though I spend most of my time coding. Please see my [CV]("Nikul_Patel_CV.pdf") for more details.


## About the Website

Welcome to my website! I built it using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed it using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I intend to use it for sharing useful resources about things I'm interested in and documenting my projects. Writing things up formally helps me to consolidate things I'm working on, and who doesn't want that!
