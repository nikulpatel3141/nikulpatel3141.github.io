Welcome to my website!

# About Me

I am currently working as a `Risk Analyst` at a Hedge Fund in London, though I spend most of my time coding. Please see my [CV](/files/nikul_patel_cv.pdf) for more details.


## About the Website

### Why It Exists

I build this website to share resources for things I'm interested in (see the [Recources](/resources) tab) and to document things I'm working on (see the [Projects](/projects) tab).





### It looks cool, how did you make it?
I built this using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed it using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). See [here](/projects/this_website) for more details.
