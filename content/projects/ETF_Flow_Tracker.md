# ETF Flow Tracker

This page tracks flows into/out of the largest 100 US Equity ETFs across SSGA, iShares and Invesco for S&P500 constituents.

These numbers give an idea of the movement of capital invested in ETFs, and hence give colour on macroeconomic trends. See [this](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fund-flow.asp#:~:text=our%20editorial%20policies-,What%20Is%20Fund%20Flow%3F,the%20performance%20of%20any%20asset.)
