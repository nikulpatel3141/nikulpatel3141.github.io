# The Infinite Game - Simon Sinek

## Overview

This is another optimistic book by Sinek. The general theme is about how making short sighted (finite) decisions can be damaging in the long run.

He discusses behaviour of organisations and individuals in the context of a never-ending (infinite) game and about the importance of having a ‘just cause’ in this context: 

> A Just Cause is a specific vision of a future state that does not yet exist; a future state so appealing that people are willing to make sacrifices in order to help advance toward that vision.

I enjoyed this book as it gave me perspective shift on how decisions are/should be made given we are all players in this ‘infinite’ game. The goal is not to win as there are no winners in an infinite game, rather the goal is to keep playing. 

I also enjoyed reading about companies (Apple, Costco, CVS) becoming successful over time by not only caring about the bottom line (... despite knowing these examples are cherry picked to serve Sinek’s narrative).

## Takeaways

1) Having a just cause is important

You will get the best out of people by giving them a sense of purpose as part of a greater cause.

> When companies make their people feel like they matter, the people come together in a way that money simply cannot buy.

2) You should seek worthy rivals

You should actively look for others worthy of comparison who expose your weaknesses, otherwise you risk losing your humility and will become complacent. Think of MySpace not seeing Facebook coming. 

3) Having the courage to lead/existential flexibility

It is important not to be stuck to particular ways of doing things. 

Notable examples are:

- Kodak: By not adopting digital technology the company became a shell of itself. 

- CVS: By Stopping purchases of tobacco products in its stores, CVS took a short term hit to revenues but shortly recovered and gained the attention of various health + image conscious brands helping it well surpass it's previous results
