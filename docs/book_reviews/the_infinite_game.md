# The Infinite Game

## Overview

This is another optimistic book by Sinek. The general theme is about how making short sighted (finite) decisions can be damaging in the long run.

He discusses behaviour of organisations and individuals in the context of a never-ending (infinite) game and about the importance of having a ‘Just Cause’: 

> A Just Cause is a specific vision of a future state that does not yet exist; a future state so appealing that people are willing to make sacrifices in order to help advance toward that vision.

I enjoyed this book as it gave me a perspective shift on how decisions should be made given we are all players in this ‘Infinite’ game.

> The goal is not to win as there are no winners in an Infinite game ... the goal is to keep playing. 


I also enjoyed reading about companies (Apple, Costco, CVS) enjoying success while not only caring about the bottom line.

## Takeaways

1) Having a Just Cause is important

You will get the best out of people by giving them a sense of purpose.

> When companies make their people feel like they matter, the people come together in a way that money simply cannot buy.

2) You should seek 'Worthy Rivals'

You should actively look for others worthy of comparison who expose your weaknesses, otherwise you risk losing your humility and will become complacent. Think of MySpace not seeing Facebook coming. 

3) Have the courage to lead

Don't be stuck to particular ways of doing things. Notable examples Grant gives are:

- Kodak: The company fell behind as the world switched to digital photography while Kodak stuck to film.

- CVS: Stopping purchases of tobacco products in its stores caused a short term hit to revenues but it gained the business of health conscious brands, helping it well surpass its previous results.
