This book is an introduction to how financial markets work, covering mostly Fixed Income and FX and how they are traded (bonds, futures, options etc).

This is recommended reading for anyone interested in finance. It covers exactly the fundamentals of the asset classes discussed which makes it a short read. For more technical details the famous books by Hull would be more appropriate.

Most technical calculations in this book are motivated by real life examples, which makes things easy to follow and appreciate in the context of the wider financial system. For example a company issuing fixed rate bonds may use an interest rate swap to meet its floating rate liabilities. 

The book is available [here](https://www.jdawiseman.com/books/pricing-money/Pricing_Money_JDAWiseman.html), at the cost of a review like this one.
