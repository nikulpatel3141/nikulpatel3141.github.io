In this book Gladewll gives an uplifting and sometimes unusual perspective on certain successful groups and things they have in common. Analysis of sucessessful populations is typically difficult due to [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#:~:text=Survivorship%20bias%20or%20survival%20bias,conclusions%20because%20of%20incomplete%20data.), though the optimistic nature of the book and its unique take on certain situations makes it a good read.

## Success Stories

The author gives examples of people becoming successful due to luck, eg Bill Gates having access to (then rarely available) computers as a child gave him an edge as a programmer. Though obviously there was no luck in Gates' choice to invest his time on computers.

A more systematic example is of Canadian hockey players. Children are grouped by birth year which gives January kids (almost) a year's growth advantage over December kids. The January players are perceived as being better and are given more attention than other players born later in the year. This advantage snowballs as they grow up since their extra coaching makes them better players. Gladwell makes the case this explains the skew in birthday months for professional Canadian Hockey players.
