This is a short book about how the HTTP protocol works. If any aspect of your work involves websites you will find this useful.

Although published over 10 years ago this book is still relevant as the basics of HTTP are mostly unchanged. It covers the following topics in an accessible way:

- HTTP requests + responses (GET/POST requests, headers, status codes)
- Caching (clientside, proxies)
- State and Security (cookies, auth)

It goes into just enough depth for an introduction into HTTP making it useful for beginners; advanced readers may also find it useful as a refresher.
