This book is about the rise and sudden collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a spin-off of Salomon Brothers' bond arbitrage desk, founded by John Merriweather (who also featured in Liar's Poker). $1 invested in March '94 would have grown to $4 in four years, before falling to < $0.50 four months later. In this four month period the fund lost $4.6 billion.

## The Rise

LTCM featured the famous [Prof. Scholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Scholes) who, along with Merriweather's impressive track record at Salomon, helped make their launch a success. They raised $1.25 billion, making it one of the largest startups ever.
