In this book Newport argues our use of digital technologies is damaging to our well-being and offers advice on how to benefit from these tools while limiting their downsides. 

## Attention Engineering

Billions of dollars are spent on designing apps and websites to maximise the time spent on them; it's no coincidence most social media icons are blue.

Features like infinite scrolling, notifications, and algorithm-driven content maximise user engagement (and hence profits) often at the expense of our mental health and productivity.

## Connection vs Conversation

Face to face conversation has a richness that digital messaging cannot match; we evolved to process cues (body language, tone, …) that we miss when texting. For this reason the author encourages prioritising real world interactions. 

## Becoming A Digital Minimalist

1. Be Selective – Don’t use technology simply because it offers *some* benefit; it must align with your values and the benefits should outweigh any downsides.
2. Optimise – Most benefits of digital technology come from a small time investment (see [Diminishing Returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns)).
3. Be Intentional – Choosing what you consume is more satisfying than passive unstructured browsing.

## Takeaways

New technologies should support your values and not be a source of value themselves. Be selective and intentional about which services you use and be happy missing out on everything else.
