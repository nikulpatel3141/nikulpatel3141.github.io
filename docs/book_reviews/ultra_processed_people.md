In this book Dr Tulleken explores Ultra Processed Food (UPF) and its consequences on our health (note this is *not* a diet book).

## What is UPF?

Informally, UPF is food that is highly processed or contains ingredients you wouldn't find in your kitchen. For example apples are not UPF but supermarket bread is (it contains chemicals called emulsifiers).

## Why is it bad?

The author argues that UPF is engineered for overconsumption:
- Softness makes it easy to eat
- The ratios of salt/fat/carbs are calibrated to trick our satiety systems
- Advertising (eg pictures of cartoon animals on cereal boxes) makes it appealing
- It has a longer shelf life and is generally cheaper than fresh produce

Since UPF companies want to maximise profits they will always do this (more consumption = more sales), which is why the authors are encouraging lawmakers to step in.

### Evidence

Several experiments are referenced which suggest UPF is generally bad for you. [An interesting one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31105044/) is a study where participants were split into UPF and non-UPF groups and were given meals with similar macronutrients (carbs, protein, fats) and were allowed to eat as much as they wanted. The UPF group consumed 500 calories more and gained 1kg of weight over two weeks. The author also [did a similar experiment](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/van_tulleken)
 informally finding similar results.

### Non-Evidence

Importantly the author also discusses studies which contradict his claims, and points out they are mostly funded by the UPF industry. This creates biased and contradictory outcomes on the health risks of consuming UPF.


## The Nestlé Boat

A surprising story presented is about the [Nestlé Boat](https://www.businessinsider.com/nestl-expands-brazil-river-barge-2017-9). To increase sales Nestlé started sending its UPF products on a boat to remote areas in Brazil. After this health problems like obesity, diabetes and tooth decay skyrocketed in these areas. 


## Takeaways

I would recommend this book to anyone who eats UPF (almost everyone does). It is well researched and written, and will make you more informed about such foods.

The biggest actionable takeaway is to reduce your consumption of UPF.
