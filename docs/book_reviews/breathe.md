I recently restarted training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) so I decided to read this book from the fighter Rickson Gracie whose family invented the sport.

The memoir covers how Ricksonâ€™s father and uncles developed BJJ, his own fighting career, and the mental side of combat, offering valuable life lessons beyond the fights themselves.

## Fighting Is Also A Mental Sport

Rickson's first big vale tudo (no rules) fight was against the then undefeated King Zulu. After a rough first round, his father calmed him, helping him win in the second round. My favourite quote from Rickson is after this fight:

> My insecure mind came from the fear of losing. If you fear something that has not even happened then quitting becomes a form of self-protection.

## Ego Will Limit You

After a seminar in France Rickson selected the 30 toughest looking attendees for a sparring match. He saved a particularly rude character for last, who turned out to be an olympic Judo player, defeating him in less than 10 seconds.

This story highlights a common theme throughout the book and in BJJ (and is why I like training the sport): it pays off to be humble. Keeping an open mind helps you learn things and keep improving.

Oss.
