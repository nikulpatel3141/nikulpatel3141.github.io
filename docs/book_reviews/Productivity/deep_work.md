# Overview

The central idea behind this book is that in congitively demanding fields "Deep Work" is highly valuable and becoming increasingly rarer.

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.

The author goes into great detail to support this statement, and sprinkles in tips throughout the book on how to do "Deep Work", the ones I've found most useful are below.

## Why is Deep Work Important

To me this seems like common sense, but the author goes further and emphasises that "Deep Work" is becoming increasingly important to thrive. I think it's an important point to make, especially with the rise of the [Attention Economy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/irabedzow/2022/09/07/how-to-break-free-from-the-attention-economy/).

The justification for Deep Work is that to thrive in today's Economy, we increasingly need to be able to:

1. learn new things quickly
2. produce high quality work quickly

... and that these two things are only possible when doing "Deep Work".

Personally I've found there is a big improvement in the quality of my work when pursuing Deep Work intentionally.


## How to do "Deep Work"

The general concept behind Deep Work is simple - focus on a cognitively demanding task, though in practice this is, without careful planning, something difficult to consistently achieve.

The author gives general rules (Embrace Boredom, Quit Social Media, Maximise time spent on Deep Work) for supporting Deep Work, though the most useful suggestion I've found is [time blocking](#time-blocking).

### Time Blocking

This involves laying out what you'll do with your time (both in and out of the office) in advance, see [time blocking](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking) for a more in depth explanation.

It forces you to be intentional with your time. This should make it easier to focus on whatever you're doing and, therefore, makes Deep Work easier.
