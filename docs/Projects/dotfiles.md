# Dotfiles

[Here](https://github.com/nikulpatel3141/dotfiles) are my configuration files for Neovim and Fish shell.

These are a work in progress, but already give a decent text editor/terminal setup.

## Why not ...

I still use other tools, but I mainly use Neovim for coding. My priority is productivity: to get something productive with minimal effort. Other tools I've used have a trade-off between productivity and setup effort.

### ... VSCode

VSCode requires less effort to setup but is less productive than Neovim overall.

I still use VSCode for running Jupyter notebooks and debugging since I haven't found suitable alternatives in Neovim.

### ... Z-Shell (ZSH)

Fish + Fisher is _much_ easier to setup than ZSH + Oh-My-ZSH, provides similar functionality, and breaks less often.
