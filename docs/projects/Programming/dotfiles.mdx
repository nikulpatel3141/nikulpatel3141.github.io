# Dotfiles

[Here](https://github.com/nikulpatel3141/dotfiles) are my configuration files for various tools ([Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/), [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/)) I use.


## Setup

I've made it easy to install and set up the tools I use from scratch, eg for `apt` based Linux distros:

```bash
cd ~

git clone https://github.com/nikulpatel3141/dotfiles

cd dotfiles/scripts

bash install_apt_pachages.sh  # install fish shell, g++, ... etc using apt

bash install_brew_pachages.sh  # installs homebrew
bash install_brew_pachages.sh  # installs homebrew packages

cd ..

# set up symlinks for the dotfiles
stow fish/
stow helix/
# ...

```

[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is a lightweight symlink manager.
