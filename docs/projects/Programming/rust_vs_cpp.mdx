Many popular Python projects are using Rust, eg: [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic), [uv, ruff, rye](https://github.com/astral-sh), [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson).

I couldn't find as many using C++, so I wanted to investigate using Rust and C++ from Python.

I'll use [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) for C++ and [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) for Rust. The associated source code is [here](https://github.com/nikulpatel3141/MandelbrotPyRsCpp).

### Why Bother

Rust and C++ are generally faster than Python but are compiled and usually harder to write. Therefore being able to call Rust or C++ code allows for better performance without the associated downsides.

Other advantages of C++ and Rust include being strongly typed and parallelism (Python's [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil/) doesn't limit C++/Rust extensions).


## Installation

### Rust

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) makes PyO3 easy to use for new projects. In your new project directory:

```bash
$ pip install maturin
...
$ maturin init  # follow the prompts
...
```

For existing projects you need to edit your `pyproject.toml` and `Cargo.toml` files. More details are [here](https://pyo3.rs/v0.22.2/getting-started#adding-to-an-existing-project).

### C++

The easiest way to install is via `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install pybind11
```

Adding to your Python build system is slightly harder as you'll need a `setup.py` like this (more details are [here](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compiling.html#modules-with-setuptools)):

```python
from glob import glob
from setuptools import setup
from pybind11.setup_helpers import Pybind11Extension, build_ext

ext_modules = [Pybind11Extension("python_example", sorted(glob("src/*.cpp")))]
...
```

There's also a one-liner to build the extension for simple use cases; I've used this approach in my example. There's a bug in the documentation for it, though I've [opened a PR](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/pull/5360) to fix it!

## Writing the Extension

### Rust

You need to 'decorate' the functions you want to expose, then register them:

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyfunction]
fn rust_function(...) -> ...

#[pymodule]
fn my_extension(m: &Bound<'_, PyModule>) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(rust_function, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}

```

### C++

Here you just need to register your functions and include the appropriate header file:

```cpp
#include <pybind11/pybind11.h>

int cpp_function(...) { ... }

PYBIND11_MODULE(mandelbrot_cpp, m) {
    m.doc() = "pybind11 example plugin"; // optional module docstring

    m.def("cpp_function", &cpp_function, "A CPP function");
}

```

I came across a few downsides with this setup:

- It [doesn't support kwargs](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/functions.html#accepting-args-and-kwargs) as is
- My IDE complains about the `PYBIND11_MODULE` block

These can be solved with some extra work but the Rust setup didn't have similar issues.

## Performance

On my (old) i5-2557M the sample script runs 40% faster using Rust than C++:

```bash
$ python main.py cpp
Language cpp took: 14.29s avg over 10 runs

$ python main.py rust
Language rust took: 8.72s avg over 10 runs
```

I'm sure I could make the C++ version just as fast (is it just some compiler flag I'm missing?), though I've made no efforts to optimise either script.


## Takeaways

Overall the Rust setup is easier to use. Things *just work* out of the box and the associated tooling is simpler (just a few lines of config in Rust vs a large `setup.py` for C++).

I also found the Rust version easier to write as the compiler gives clearer error messages, though the Rust learning curve is definitely steeper than for C++.

There are issues I haven't considered (eg scalability, maintainability, etc), especially for larger systems, however for relatively small projects Rust seems easier to use than C++ to create Python extensions, which may explain the recent popularity of such libraries written with Rust.


## The Result

This post would be incomplete without plotting the results!

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import mandelbrot_rs

result = np.array(mandelbrot_rs.generate_mandelbrot(-2, 2, -2, 2, 1000, 10)).reshape(1000, 1000)
plt.matshow(result)
plt.show()
```
