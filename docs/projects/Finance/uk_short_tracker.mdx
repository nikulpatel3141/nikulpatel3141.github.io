Participants in the UK financial market are required to disclose their positions when above a certain threshold (0.2% of shares outstanding as of writing) - these are published [here](https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/short-selling/notification-disclosure-net-short-positions) daily. Below is a monitor based on these disclosures.

## Code
The code to generate this report is on my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/nikulpatel3141/UK-Short-Tracker), along with a README to explain how it works.

## Metrics

- Return: the (adjusted) return of the security
- PnL: the disclosed PnL from the short position
  - Note: this figure will not be entirely inaccurate since
    1) It doesn't account for intraday PnL
    2) The short positions are only reported to 1dp
- Days to Cover: The number of days it will take to fully liquidate the position at 100% trading volume (22 day average)

### Context

Here's some background behind the metrics calculations:

- Lookback of 5 days:
  - Typically the funds disclosing shorts won't be actively trading in and out positions due to slippage concerns
  - I'd expect any trading that happens will take place over a few days
    - justified by the DTC column - most are >1 day
  - Hence, a lookback period of >1 day makes sense
- Days to cover:
  - A useful metric since if this is large and shorts perform badly, it's difficult to exit the position
    - See this page on [short squeezes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp#:~:text=A%20short%20squeeze%20happens%20when,demonstrate%20a%20strong%20short%20interest.) for more information
- PnL:
  - A lot of these funds are long-short meaning they will have a long position in a security for these short positions
  - Hence PnL relative to a benchmark might be more useful than raw PnL
  - In the original code I included PnL relative to VUKE (a FTSE100 ETF), however the results table didn't render properly so I have excluded it for now
