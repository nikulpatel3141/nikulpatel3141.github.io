# Nikul's Website

Hi, welcome to my website!

# About

I build this website to learn more about web development and to share things I'm interested in/working on.

## It looks cool, how did you make it?
I am migrating this website from Hugo to Docusaurus because I want to improve my JavaScript skills and learn how to use React.

~I built this using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed it using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). See [here](/projects/this_website) for more details.~

## Getting in Touch
Contact me via LinkedIn/Email (details on the homepage) if you'd like to get in touch.
